        <header>What is Python?</header>
        <p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.</p>
        <p>It is used for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>web development (server-side),</li>
            <li>software development,</li>
            <li>mathematics,</li>
            <li>system scripting.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Python can be used on a server to create web applications, alongside software to create workflows, and to connect to database systems. It can read and modify files, handle big data, and perform complex mathematics. Additionally, Python is suitable for rapid prototyping as well as production-ready software development.</p>      
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Why_Python?">
        <header>Why Python?</header>
        <p>Python works on different platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, and Raspberry Pi. It has a simple syntax similar to the English language, allowing developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages. Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning code can be executed as soon as it is written, enabling quick prototyping. It can be treated in a procedural, object-oriented, or functional way.</p>

      <header>Syntax compared to others</header>
      <p>Python was designed for readability, with similarities to the English language and influences from mathematics. It uses new lines to complete commands, unlike other programming languages that often use semicolons or parentheses. Python relies on indentation and whitespace to define the scope of loops, functions, and classes, whereas other programming languages typically use curly brackets for this purpose.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
        <header>Hello world</header>
        <p>To create a "Hello, World!" program in Python, follow these simple steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open a Text Editor or IDE. You can use any text editor (like Notepad, Sublime Text, or VS Code) or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm or Thonny.</li>
            <li>In your editor, type the following line of code:<br>
                <code><pre>print("Hello, World!")</pre></code><br>
                This line uses the print() function to output the text "Hello, World!" to the screen.</li>
            <li>Save the file with a ".py" extension, for example, "hello_world.py".</li>
            <li>Open your command line or terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and run the program by typing:<br>
                <code><pre>python hello_world.py</pre></code></li>
            <li>You should see the output:<br>
                <code><pre>Hello, World!</pre></code>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This simple program demonstrates basic Python syntax and the use of the "print()" function to display text.</p>
      </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Python_Variables">
        <header>Python Variables</header>
        <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.</p>
        <p>Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. Example</p>
        <code><pre>x = 5
y = "John"</pre></code>
        <p>Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set. Example:</p>
        <code><pre>x = 4       <i># x is of type int</i>
x = "Sally" <i># x is now of type str</i></pre></code>
        <p>If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.</p>
        <code><pre>x = str(3)    <i># x will be '3'</i>
y = int(3)    <i># y will be 3</i>
z = float(3)  <i># z will be 3.0</i></pre></code>
        <p>You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function. Also,string variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes and variable names are case-sensitive.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Names">
        <header>Variable Names</header>
        <p>A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character</li>
            <li>A variable name cannot start with a number</li>
            <li>A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )</li>
            <li>Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)</li>
            <li>A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examples of legal variable names</p>
        <code><pre>myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"</pre></code>
        <p>Examples of illegal variable names</p>
        <code><pre>2myvar = "John"
my-var = "John"
my var = "John"</pre></code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Assign_Multiple_Values">
        <header>Assign Multiple Values</header>
        <p>Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:</p>
        <code><pre>x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"</pre></code>
        <p>And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:</p>
        <code><pre>x = y = z = "Orange"</pre></code>
        <p>If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called <i>unpacking.</i></p>
        <code><pre>fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

x, y, z = fruits</pre></code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Global_Variables">
        <header>Global Variables</header>
        <p>Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples in the previous pages) are known as global variables.</p>
        <p>Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside. Example:</p>
        <code><pre>x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
    print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()</pre></code>
        <p>If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function. The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global and with the original value. Example:</p>
        <code><pre>x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
    x = "fantastic"
    print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)</pre></code>
        <p>Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function. To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.</p>
        <code><pre>def myfunc():
    global x
    x = "fantastic"

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)</pre></code>
        <p>Also, use the global keyword if you want to change a global variable inside a function.</p>
        <code><pre>x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
    global x
    x = "fantastic"

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)</pre></code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
        <header>Data Types</header>
        <p>In programming, data type is an important concept.</p>
        <p>Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.</p>
        <p>Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Text Type: <a class="type-list">str</a></li>
            <li>Numeric Types: <a class="type-list">int</a>, <a class="type-list">float</a>, <a class="type-list">complex</a></li>
            <li>Sequence Types: <a class="type-list">list</a>, <a class="type-list">tuple</a>, <a class="type-list">range</a></li>
            <li>Mapping Type: <a class="type-list">dict</a></li>
            <li>Set Types: <a class="type-list">set</a>, <a class="type-list">frozenset</a></li>
            <li>Boolean Type: <a class="type-list">bool</a></li>
            <li>Binary Types: <a class="type-list">bytes</a>, <a class="type-list">bytearray</a>, <a class="type-list">memoryview</a></li>
            <li>None Type: <a class="type-list">NoneType</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function, as mentioned before.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Python_If...Else">
        <header>Python If...Else</header>
        <p>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Equals: <a class="type-list">a == b</a></li>
            <li>Not Equals: <a class="type-list">a != b</a></li>
            <li>Less than: <a class="type-list">a &lt; b</a></li>
            <li>Less than or equal to: <a class="type-list">a &lt;= b</a></li>
            <li>Greater than: <a class="type-list">a &gt; b</a></li>
            <li>Greater than or equal to: <a class="type-list">a &gt;= b</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops. An "if statement" is written by using the <a class="type-list">if</a> keyword.</p>
        <code><pre>a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
    print("b is greater than a")</pre></code>
        <p>In this example we use two variables, a and b, which are used as part of the if statement to test whether b is greater than a. As a is 33, and b is 200, we know that 200 is greater than 33, and so we print to screen that "b is greater than a".</p>
        <p>Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.</p>
        <code><pre>a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
print("b is greater than a") # you will get an error</pre></code>
        <p>The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".</p>
        <code><pre>a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
    print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
    print("a and b are equal")</pre></code>
        <p>In this example a is equal to b, so the first condition is not true, but the elif condition is true, so we print to screen that "a and b are equal".</p>
        <p>The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.</p>
        <code><pre>a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
    print("b is greater than a")
else:
    print("b is not greater than a")</pre></code>
        <p>You can also have an else with the elif.</p>
        <code><pre>a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
    print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
    print("a and b are equal")
else:
    print("a is greater than b")
        </pre></code>
        <p>You can also combine conditional statements, with the keyworlds:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>And: <a class="type-list">if a > b and c > a</a></li>
            <li>Or: <a class="type-list">if a > b or a > c</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The not keyword is a logical operator, and is used to reverse the result of the conditional statement.</p>
        <code><pre>a = 33
b = 200
if not a > b:
    print("a is NOT greater than b")</pre></code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="While_Loops">
        <header>While Loops</header>
        <p>With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.</p>
        <code><pre>i = 1
while i < 6:
    print(i)
    i += 1

<i># remember to increment i, or else the loop will continue forever.</i></pre></code>
        <p>The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.</p>
        <p>With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true.</p>
        <code><pre>i = 1
while i < 6:
    print(i)
    if i == 3:
        break
    i += 1</pre></code>
        <p>With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next.</p>
        <code><pre>i = 0
while i < 6:
    i += 1
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)</pre></code>
        <p>With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true.</p>
        <code><pre>i = 1
while i < 6:
    print(i)
    i += 1
else:
    print("i is no longer less than 6")</pre></code>
    </section> 
    <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
        <header>Functions</header>
        <p>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result.</p>
        <p>In Python a function is defined using the <a class="type-list">def</a> keyword:</p>
        <code><pre>def my_function():
    print("Hello from a function")</pre></code>
        <p>To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:</p>
        <code><pre>def my_function():
            print("Hello from a function")

my_function()</pre></code>
        <P>Information can be passed into functions as arguments.</P>
        <p>Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.</p>
        <p>The following example has a function with one argument (fname). When the function is called, we pass along a first name, which is used inside the function to print the full name:</p>
        <code><pre>def my_function(fname):
    print(fname + " Refsnes")

my_function("Emil")
my_function("Tobias")
my_function("Linus")</pre></code>
        <p>By default, a function must be called with the correct number of arguments. Meaning that if your function expects 2 arguments, you have to call the function with 2 arguments, not more, and not less.</p>
        <p>If you try to call the function with 1 or 3 arguments, you will get an error.</p>
        <p>If you do not know how many arguments that will be passed into your function, add a * before the parameter name in the function definition. This way the function will receive a tuple of arguments, and can access the items accordingly.</p>
        <p>You can also send arguments with the key = value syntax. This way the order of the arguments does not matter.</p>
        <code><pre>def my_function(child3, child2, child1):
    print("The youngest child is " + child3)

my_function(child1 = "Emil", child2 = "Tobias", child3 = "Linus")</pre></code>
        <p>If you do not know how many keyword arguments that will be passed into your function, add two asterisk: ** before the parameter name in the function definition. This way the function will receive a dictionary of arguments, and can access the items accordingly.</p>
        <p>To let a function return a value, use the return statement:</p>
        <code><pre>def my_function(x):
    return 5 * x

print(my_function(3))
print(my_function(5))
print(my_function(9))</pre></code>
        <p>function definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a function definition with no content, put in the <a class="type-list">pass</a> statement to avoid getting an error.</p>
        <p>Python also accepts function recursion, which means a defined function can call itself.</p>
        <p>Recursion is a common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself. This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result.</p>
        <p>The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. However, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.</p>
        <p>In this example, <a class="type-list">tri_recursion()</a> is a function that we have defined to call itself ("recurse"). We use the k variable as the data, which decrements (-1) every time we recurse. The recursion ends when the condition is not greater than 0 (i.e. when it is 0).</p>
        <p>To a new developer it can take some time to work out how exactly this works, best way to find out is by testing and modifying it.</p>
        <code><pre>def tri_recursion(k):
    if(k > 0):
        result = k + tri_recursion(k - 1)
        print(result)
    else:
        result = 0
    return result
    
print("\n\nRecursion Example Results")
tri_recursion(6)</pre></code>
